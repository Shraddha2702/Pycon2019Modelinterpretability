    "A word of warning though, it can get extremely slow to compute SHAP values using the model-agnostic KernelExplainer. That means that if your model is tree based (tree explainer), neural networks (deep explainer) or linear, you'll be able to get the best out of `shap` with good performance. But for other models, such as KNN, SVM or even a custom sklearn Pipeline object allowing you to work with categorical features directly instead of dummies, you will have to either use the slow `KernelExplainer` or prefer other more approximative techniques such as LIME for local explanations or permutation importance for global ones."
